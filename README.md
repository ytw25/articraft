# articraft

Generate articulated 3D objects from prompts and inspect them locally.

## 1. Install Prerequisites

You need:

- Python 3.12 recommended (`.python-version` is committed for `uv`), or Python 3.11
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)
- [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if you want the viewer and frontend hooks ready locally

Important:
`cadquery` depends on `vtk`, and the currently supported wheels for this repo do not install on CPython 3.13. The repo pins Python 3.12 for `uv` via `.python-version`. If you are not using `uv`'s pinned interpreter behavior, use Python 3.11 or 3.12 and avoid 3.13+.

If you do not have `just` yet:

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install just

# cross-platform installer
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/bin
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"
```

## 2. Run Setup

From the repo root:

```bash
just setup
```

This does the initial local setup:

- creates `.env` from `.env.example` if `.env` does not exist yet, seeding supported provider env vars from your current shell when present
- installs Python dev dependencies, including `pre-commit` and `ruff`
- installs `viewer/web` dependencies when `npm` is available
- installs the git `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks
- installs the managed git `post-commit` hook used to auto-sync record metadata such as `author` and `rated_by`
- initializes local storage under `data/`
- builds the dataset manifest used by the viewer

You can verify the hook setup with:

```bash
uv run python scripts/git_hooks.py check-post-commit
```

If you skip `just setup` and install pieces manually, record metadata will not auto-sync after commits until the managed post-commit hook is installed.

## 3. Add Your API Key

Open `.env` and set one provider key:

```text
Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI key in `.env`
```

or:

```text
Set `GEMINI_API_KEYS` to your Gemini keys in `.env`
```

Optional:

```text
Set `ARTICRAFT_MAX_COST_USD` to a positive per-run USD budget default in `.env`
```

## 4. Open The Viewer Fast

If you just cloned the repo and want to browse saved records in the viewer, precompile the saved records first:

```bash
just compile-all
```

This materializes the viewer-ready artifacts for saved records.

Then open the viewer:

```bash
just viewer
```

This starts the local API, builds the web app if needed, and opens the viewer.

## 5. Generate Your First Object

Run:

```bash
just wb "Create a realistic articulated desk lamp with a weighted base, two hinged arms, and an adjustable lamp head."
```

This saves a generated record into the local workbench.

If you do not pass overrides, `just wb` defaults to:

```bash
model=gpt-5.4
thinking=high
sdk=
```

To change either setting, pass overrides on the same command:

```bash
# Use a different model (same SDK)
just model=gemini-3-flash-preview wb "Create a compact desk fan with adjustable tilt."

# Use the canonical SDK explicitly
just sdk=sdk wb "Create a compact desk fan with adjustable tilt."

# Change both model and SDK together
just model=gpt-5.4 sdk=sdk wb "Create a compact desk fan with adjustable tilt."
```

To stop a run after it exceeds a USD budget, pass `max_cost_usd=...`:

```bash
just max_cost_usd=1.5 wb "Create a compact desk fan with adjustable tilt."
```

For `wb` and `wb-init`, leaving `sdk` blank uses the canonical pipeline. Use `sdk=sdk` for an explicit override. Record-based commands like `compile`, `compile-strict`, `compile-unsafe`, and `rerun` use the record's saved `sdk_package` unless you override them with `sdk=...`.

To run a single prompt directly into a dataset category instead of the workbench, use:

```bash
just category=grill_with_hinged_lid wb-category "Create a backyard gas grill with a wheeled lower cart, a rectangular cookbox, side shelves, a front control panel, and a domed lid hinged along the rear edge of the cookbox."
```

`wb-category` accepts the same `model=...`, `thinking=...`, `sdk=...`, `image=...`, and `design_audit=...` overrides as `wb`. It auto-allocates a collision-resistant `ds_<category>_<token>` dataset ID for the target category unless you also pass `dataset_id=...`.

The underlying CLI command is:

```bash
uv run articraft-dataset --repo-root . run-single \
  "Create a backyard gas grill with a wheeled lower cart, a rectangular cookbox, side shelves, a front control panel, and a domed lid hinged along the rear edge of the cookbox." \
  --category-slug grill_with_hinged_lid \
  --provider openai \
  --model-id gpt-5.4 \
  --thinking-level high \
  --max-cost-usd 2.0 \
  --sdk-package sdk
```

If the target category slug already exists, the new record is appended under that category. If it does not exist yet, the command creates the category metadata automatically using a slug-derived title.

## 6. Run And Resume Dataset Batches

Dataset batches are driven by CSV specs under `data/batch_specs/`. The CSV filename stem becomes the batch's `batch_spec_id`.

That detail matters for resume:

- `--resume` looks up the latest prior run for the same `batch_spec_id`
- if you rename `chairs_v1.csv` to `chairs_v2.csv`, resume will treat it as a different batch
- resume also matches rows by `row_id`, so stable `row_id` values are important if you plan to retry or edit a spec later

### 6.1 Create the spec

Start with the built-in template:

```bash
just name=<batch-id> batch-spec-new
```

This creates:

```text
data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv
```

with the current v1 header:

```csv
row_id,category_slug,category_title,prompt,provider,model_id,thinking_level,max_turns,max_cost_usd,sdk_package,scaffold_mode,label,design_audit
```

### 6.2 Fill the CSV

Each row is one dataset generation job.

| Column | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `row_id` | Recommended | Stable row identifier used by resume. If omitted, it defaults to `row_0001`, `row_0002`, and so on, based on row order. For resumable batches, set this explicitly and do not change it after the first run. |
| `category_slug` | Yes | Dataset category slug. |
| `category_title` | Sometimes | Required for any row whose `category_slug` does not already exist in repo storage. If a new category appears on multiple rows, include the title on each of those rows. |
| `prompt` | Yes | The generation prompt. |
| `provider` | Yes | Must be `openai` or `gemini`. |
| `model_id` | Yes | Model to use for that row. It must agree with `provider`. |
| `thinking_level` | Yes | Must be `low`, `med`, or `high`. |
| `max_turns` | Yes | Positive integer turn cap for the row. |
| `max_cost_usd` | No | Optional positive per-row USD budget. If blank, the row inherits the batch CLI flag or `ARTICRAFT_MAX_COST_USD`. |
| `sdk_package` | Yes | Use `sdk`. |
| `scaffold_mode` | No | Optional `lite` or `strict`. If blank, the row inherits the batch CLI default. |
| `label` | No | Optional free-form label for your own tracking. |
| `design_audit` | No | `true` or `false`. If blank, the row inherits the CLI default for the batch. |

Batch CSV v1 notes:

- `image_path` is not supported in batch CSV v1
- duplicate `row_id` values are rejected
- if the batch introduces a new category and `category_title` is missing, validation fails before the run starts

Example:

```csv
row_id,category_slug,category_title,prompt,provider,model_id,thinking_level,max_turns,max_cost_usd,sdk_package,scaffold_mode,label,design_audit
hinge_01,hinge,Hinge,"Create a steel door hinge with two rectangular leaves and a center pin.",openai,gpt-5.4,high,12,1.5,sdk,lite,baseline,true
hinge_02,hinge,Hinge,"Create a compact cabinet hinge with offset leaves and a short pin.",gemini,gemini-3-flash-preview,med,10,,sdk,strict,compact,false
```

### 6.3 Run the first pass

Use `uv` directly:

```bash
uv run articraft-dataset --repo-root . run-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv --row-concurrency 8 --subprocess-concurrency auto
uv run articraft-dataset --repo-root . run-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv --row-concurrency 8 --subprocess-concurrency auto --max-cost-usd 2.0
```

Or use the `just` wrapper:

```bash
just row_concurrency=8 subprocess_concurrency=auto dataset-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv
just row_concurrency=8 subprocess_concurrency=auto max_cost_usd=2.0 dataset-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv
```

Useful execution controls:

- `--row-concurrency`: maximum number of live batch rows at once; use `auto`, `max`, or a positive integer
- `--subprocess-concurrency`: maximum number of compile/QC/probe subprocess-heavy operations at once; use `auto`, `max`, or a positive integer
- `--max-cost-usd`: default per-row USD budget for rows whose `max_cost_usd` CSV cell is blank
- `--design-audit` or `--no-design-audit`: set the batch-wide default for rows whose `design_audit` cell is blank

If any row fails, the batch exits non-zero. That is expected. The normal recovery path is to fix the issue and rerun with `--resume`.

### 6.4 Resume a batch safely

The most common recovery command is:

```bash
uv run articraft-dataset --repo-root . run-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv --row-concurrency 8 --subprocess-concurrency auto --resume
```

or with `just`:

```bash
just row_concurrency=8 subprocess_concurrency=auto resume=true dataset-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv
```

What `--resume` does:

- reuses the latest prior run for the same `batch_spec_id`
- resumes that run in place under the existing `data/cache/runs/<run_id>/`
- reuses the prior `dataset_id` and `record_id` allocations from `allocations.json`
- preserves rows that already have durable successful outputs instead of rerunning them
- by default, reruns rows whose latest status is `failed`, `pending`, or `running`

Resume policies:

```bash
uv run articraft-dataset --repo-root . run-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv --resume --resume-policy failed_only
uv run articraft-dataset --repo-root . run-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv --resume --resume-policy failed_or_pending
uv run articraft-dataset --repo-root . run-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv --resume --resume-policy all
```

- `failed_only`: rerun only rows whose latest status is `failed`
- `failed_or_pending`: rerun `failed`, `pending`, and interrupted `running` rows; this is the default
- `all`: rerun every row using the existing allocations

Important resume rules:

- keep the CSV filename stable so the `batch_spec_id` stays the same
- keep `row_id` stable; changing or reordering implicit row ids can break resume matching
- by default, resume rejects spec changes for `category_slug`, `prompt`, `provider`, `model_id`, `thinking_level`, `max_turns`, `max_cost_usd`, `sdk_package`, `scaffold_mode`, and `design_audit`
- if a row already produced a durable record but the cached state says `running`, resume reconciles that success instead of rerunning it

You can bypass the spec-compatibility check:

```bash
uv run articraft-dataset --repo-root . run-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv --resume --allow-resume-spec-mismatch
```

or:

```bash
just resume=true allow_resume_spec_mismatch=true dataset-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv
```

Use `--allow-resume-spec-mismatch` only for deliberate recovery work. It forces the current CSV to reuse the prior run's row allocations even though the row definitions no longer match.

This is the escape hatch for "retry the same row, but with different execution settings." A common example is raising `max_turns` or `max_cost_usd` for failed rows, or switching a failed row to a different `provider`, `model_id`, `thinking_level`, `sdk_package`, `scaffold_mode`, `prompt`, or `design_audit` setting before resuming.

Typical override workflow:

1. Edit the existing row in `data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv` without changing its `row_id`.
2. Resume with `--allow-resume-spec-mismatch`.
3. Usually pair that with `--resume-policy failed_only` so already successful rows stay preserved.

Example:

```bash
uv run articraft-dataset --repo-root . run-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv --row-concurrency 8 --subprocess-concurrency auto --resume --resume-policy failed_only --allow-resume-spec-mismatch
```

or:

```bash
just row_concurrency=8 subprocess_concurrency=auto resume=true resume_policy=failed_only allow_resume_spec_mismatch=true dataset-batch data/batch_specs/<batch-id>.csv
```

When you do this:

- the rerun uses the current CSV values for row execution settings
- the rerun still keeps the existing `dataset_id`, `record_id`, and prompt allocation from the original run
- only rows selected by the current `resume_policy` will actually rerun
- keep `row_id` and the batch filename stable
- do not treat `category_slug` as a routine override during resume; it is part of dataset identity, and changing it while reusing prior allocations can lead to confusing results

### 6.5 Know where the outputs and state go

After a successful row:

- the canonical record is written under `data/records/<record-id>/`
- dataset storage and category metadata are updated

During the batch:

- resumable run state lives under `data/cache/runs/<run_id>/`
- `run.json` stores batch-level metadata
- `allocations.json` stores the stable `dataset_id` and `record_id` assigned to each `row_id`
- `results.jsonl` stores one result row per batch row
- `state/<row_id>.json` stores per-row attempt status

If you need to inspect or debug a resume decision, `allocations.json`, `results.jsonl`, and `state/<row_id>.json` are the first files to check.
